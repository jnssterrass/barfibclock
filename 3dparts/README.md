# Summary

https://youtu.be/tmbpg6cOrH0

This fully 3D-printed clock is probably unlike any other digital clock you have seen. While in a regular LCD or LED-based digital clock the 7 segments for each of the four digits are switched on and off, the segments of this clock physically pivot in and out of view with the help of 28 individually controlled servo motors. The servos are connected to an array of servo controllers operated by a Raspberry PI application.

This huge clock (23" x 8") is sure to be an attention grabber and a great conversation piece in a crowd of computer and robotics nerds. And it shows precise time too!

Just like our <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2471044">Rubik's Cube Solving Robot</a>, this model is fully 3D-printed. Other than servos and electronics, it has no traditionally manufactured parts.
